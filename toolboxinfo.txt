These are some tools to assist with processing and formatting the data correctly
for a cnn. 

The cnn_data_tools etc assist with condensing the extracted signals in a 
dataframe form to that of a "condensed" form where each row denotes an image
and there are 120 columns  (4x30).

Before being sent to a cnn they must then be pre-processed and reshaped in 
a 4x30 form. 

The PulseHeight.R code assists with producing pulse height plots from the 
condensed data both image heatmaps and just the average signal on its own.

The Distributiontools.R file assists with producing histograms concerning the
mean ADC, ADC sums etc for condensed data.
